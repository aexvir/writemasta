WriteMasta
==========

WriteMasta started as a school project. It's a basic text editor developed using the Java Platform and the Qt libraries adapted to Java (QtJambi).

As i'm on vacation, I uploaded the project to GitHub to work easier on it, and to share it with anyone. I'm going to add more features and support more languages. Improving the User Interface is also on my plan.
